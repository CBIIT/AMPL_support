We have constructed hand-curated custom molecular database by scanning 
COVID-19 papers that appeared after March 01 2020. 
We have tried to gather all the relevant COVID-19 drug discovery papers 
to extract small molecule(s) that showed anti viral activity and any related
information from the papers. If you happen to notice any omissions, please feel free to include them (time-stamp the files) 
and upload the new files or let us know (Naomi or Ravi). 

The database has ~ 250 compounds and we are updating the database once 
every week.
