We have constructed the molecular database by scanning COVID-19 papers that appeared after March 01 2020. 
We have tried to gather all the relevant COVID-19 drug discovery papers to extract small molecule(s) 
that showed anti viral activity. If you happen to notice any omissions, please feel free to include them (time-stamp the files) 
and upload the new files or let us know (Naomi or Ravi). 

Thank you
